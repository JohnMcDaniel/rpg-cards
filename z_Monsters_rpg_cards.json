When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. Creature makes DC 17 Dexterity save, 35(10d6) cold or half on save. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the Devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes."

      "description |Fey Charm| The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours. The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time."

The Ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The Ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the Ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the Ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. On end, the Ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this Ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends."

Once the Golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. The Golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk Golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. Must be able to hear its creator, who uses action to make DC15 Persuasion check.

If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease- a minuscule slaad egg. A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process. If the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated. "
