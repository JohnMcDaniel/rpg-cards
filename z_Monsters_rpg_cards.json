If the blemmyes takes 20 damage or more during a single turn from a creature inside it, the blemmyes must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the blemmyes. The blemmyes can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the blemmyes dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone."

     "description |Cloak of Swarms (Recharge 5–6)| Akyishigal can emit a cloud of flying, stinging insects from his mouth, his eyes, and the tears in his skin. This cloud surrounds him to a depth of 5 feet. When the cloak is active, all attacks against him are made with disadvantage, and Akyishigal can see in all directions (through the insects’ eyes). Any living creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of Akyishigal takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the character is also poisoned for 1 hour. The swarm lasts for 5 rounds; it dissipates instantly if Akyishigal takes 30 or more damage from a nonweapon attack that he doesn’t have resistance to. While poisoned by the Cloak of Swarms, a character emits a stench of decomposition. All uncontrolled vermin attack that character on sight and in preference to other targets."

A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant's soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target's body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light. As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim's soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain.

Ia’Affrat can consume a living victim; the target takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage per hour while Ia’Affrat inhabits its body, and Ia’Affrat regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. When inhabiting a body, Ia’Affrat can choose to have any spell it casts with a range of self, target the inhabited body rather than itself. The skin of a creature inhabited by Ia’Affrat crawls with the forms of the insects inside. Ia’Affrat can hide this telltale sign with a Charisma (Deception) check against a viewer’s passive Insight.
