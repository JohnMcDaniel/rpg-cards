If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain.

If Ia’Affrat inhabits a dead body, it can animate it and control its movements, effectively becoming a zombie for as long as it remains inside. In a living victim, Ia’Affrat can control the victim’s movement and actions as if using dominate monster (save DC 19) on the victim. Ia’Affrat can consume a living victim; the target takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage per hour while Ia’Affrat inhabits its body, and Ia’Affrat regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. When inhabiting a body, Ia’Affrat can choose to have any spell it casts with a range of self, target the inhabited body rather than itself. The skin of a creature inhabited by Ia’Affrat crawls with the forms of the insects inside. Ia’Affrat can hide this telltale sign with a Charisma (Deception) check against a viewer’s passive Insight. A greater restoration spell or comparable magic forces Ia’Affrat to abandon the host. "

      "description |Dust Devil| A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of sand magically forms on a point the al-Aeshma can see within 120 feet of it. The dust devil lasts as long as the al-Aeshma maintains concentration (as if a spell). Any creature but the al-Aeshma that enters the dust devil must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it; any number of creatures may be restrained this way. At the start of a restrained creature's turn, it takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The al-Aeshma can move the dust devil up to 60 feet as an action; restrained creatures move with it. The dust devil ends if the al-Aeshma loses sight of it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the dust devil, including itself, by making a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, it moves to the nearest space outside the dust devil."
